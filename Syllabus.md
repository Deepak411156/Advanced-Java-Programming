Presentation: Students will be divided into groups and each group will be provided with a topic for presentation. It will be evaluated individually as well as group-wise. Individual students have to make presentations on the given topics. 
Mid-term examination: It is a written examination and the questions will be asked covering all the topics in the session of the course. 
Discussion and participation: Students will be evaluated on the basis of their active participation in the classroom discussions. 
Instructional Techniques: All topics are discussed with emphasis on real-world application. List of instructional techniques is as follows: 
•	Lecture and Discussion 
•	Group work and Individual work 
•	Assignments 
•	Presentation by Students 
•	Quizzes 
•	Guest Lecture 
Students are advised to attend all the classes and complete all the assignments within the specified time period. If a student does not attend the class(es), it is his/her sole responsibility to cover the topic(s) taught during that period. If a student fails to attend a formal exam/quiz/test, there won’t be any provision for re-exam. Unless and until the student clears one semester he/she will not be allowed to study in the following semesters. 
Laboratory Work 
Student should design at least two Projects. Desktop Application (Address Book, Library system etc), Simple network Application (e.g. Chatting Application) or Simple Web Applications (online banking Application, Online Music Application, etc)
